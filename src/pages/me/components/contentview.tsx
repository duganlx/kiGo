          the company&apos;s system center, so as to better support the work of colleagues in other
          business departments of the company. The specifics of the work can be abstracted into four
          areas, specifically:
          <ol>
            <li>
              (Analysis) When a colleague from another department raises a new requirement, I need
              to communicate with that colleague to understand his claim and the desired effect.
              Next, I need to assess the value and urgency of the requirement.
            </li>
            <li>
              (Design) I need to go for prototype drawings based on the requirements and check with
              that colleague for functionality and style.
            </li>
            <li>
              (Development) Utilizing the expertise I have, I choose the appropriate way to code the
              functionality for implementation. After self-testing for accuracy, deployed the
              program to the test environment and notified the test engineers to validate the
              developed functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              (Testing) Analyze and deal with the problems identified. Once all issues have been
              addressed, the program will be deployed to the production environment and made
              available to business colleagues to use and receive feedback.
